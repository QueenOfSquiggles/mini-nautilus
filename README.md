# mini-nautilus
 A subnautica clone made for GodotWild Jam January 2022
 
 ## Branch "post-jam-edits":
 
 this is a seperate branch so I can work on improvements/refactoring while the voting period of the jam continues. I primarily want to hack this game apart into individually functional modules that can be reused for future games. There are a lot of systems in this game that can be repurposed and/or generalized with little to no effort.
